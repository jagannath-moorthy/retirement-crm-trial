## Technology User Stories

Considering the RetirementSaaS platform is going to be built with a Supabase backend, a React web frontend hosted on Vercel with Whatsapp API integration, here are the list of technical user stories

**Core Backend (Supabase):**

1.  **Story:** As a Development Team, we need to set up a Supabase project with the initial database schema so that we can persist core application data (residents, staff, etc.).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *    A Supabase project is created and accessible.
        *    The database schema based on the "Database Structure" document is created with initial tables and relationships.
        *    Basic connection to the Supabase database can be established.

2.  **Story:** As a Development Team, we need to implement user authentication and authorization using Supabase Auth so that users can securely log in and their access is controlled.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *    User registration (email/password) functionality is implemented.
        *    User login and logout functionality is implemented.
        *    Basic role-based access control (e.g., for Admin, Manager, Staff, Resident) is set up within Supabase Auth.
        *    Secure password hashing is enabled.

3.  **Story:** As a Development Team, we need to define and implement the initial set of Supabase database functions and triggers to handle core business logic and data integrity.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *    Basic database functions for common data operations (e.g., creating a new resident, assigning staff to a community) are implemented.
        *    Triggers for maintaining data consistency (e.g., automatically updating timestamps) are implemented.

4.  **Story:** As a Development Team, we need to configure Supabase Storage for handling file uploads (e.g., resident photos, documents).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *    Supabase Storage is enabled and configured.
        *    Functionality to upload and retrieve files is implemented.
        *    Basic access control for file storage is configured.

**Core Frontend (React on Vercel):**

1.  **Story:** As a Development Team, we need to create a basic React application structure with routing so that we can navigate between different sections of the platform.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *    A new React application is set up using a framework like Create React App or Next.js.
        *    Basic page routing is implemented (e.g., for login, dashboard).
        *    A basic UI framework (e.g., Material UI, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS) is integrated.

2.  **Story:** As a Development Team, we need to implement API client-side logic to communicate with the Supabase backend.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *    A library for making API calls (e.g., fetch, axios, or the Supabase JavaScript client) is integrated.
        *    Functions for basic CRUD operations on key entities (e.g., residents, staff) are implemented.
        *    Error handling for API calls is implemented.

3.  **Story:** As a Development Team, we need to implement basic UI components for user authentication (login, registration).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *    Login form is created and integrated with Supabase Auth.
        *    Registration form (if required for MVP) is created and integrated with Supabase Auth.
        *    Basic form validation is implemented.

4.  **Story:** As a Development Team, we need to configure Vercel for deployment of the React frontend.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *    A Vercel project is created and linked to the frontend codebase repository.
        *    The React application can be successfully deployed to a Vercel URL.
        *    Basic environment variables for API endpoints are configured in Vercel.

**Potential Integrations (WhatsApp):**

1.  **Story:** As a Development Team, we need to set up a WhatsApp Business API account (Sandbox environment) so that we can test basic message sending capabilities.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *    A WhatsApp Business API Sandbox account is created.
        *    Basic API credentials are obtained.
        *    Ability to send and receive test messages using the API (even if just to a test number) is confirmed.

**General Platform Setup:**

1.  **Story:** As a Development Team, we need to set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using Vercel and potentially GitHub Actions (or similar) for automated deployment of frontend changes.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *    A basic CI/CD pipeline is configured to automatically deploy the frontend to Vercel on code commits to the main branch.
