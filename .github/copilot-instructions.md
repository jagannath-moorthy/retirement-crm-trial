This project is a CRM targeted at the retirement community. The backend is managed with Supabase (PostgreSQL, authentication, API), and the frontend is a React web app (Vite, TypeScript) designed to be responsive for both mobile and desktop users.

- Place all backend documentation and SQL scripts in the `/backend` folder.
- Frontend code is in the root directory (Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold).
- Ensure all code and UI are accessible and user-friendly for older adults.
