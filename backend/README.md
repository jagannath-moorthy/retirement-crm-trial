# Supabase Backend Setup

This folder is intended for Supabase backend configuration and documentation.

## Getting Started
1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2. Set up your database schema and authentication.
3. Use the API keys and project URL in your frontend React app.
4. Store SQL migrations, API docs, and other backend-related files here as needed.

## Folder Structure
- `/sql` — SQL migration scripts
- `/docs` — API documentation or notes

## Note
Supabase is a hosted backend. Most configuration is managed via the Supabase dashboard. Use this folder for versioning and documentation.
